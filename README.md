ONLINE COURSE PORTAL 

The main objective of the Online Course Portal project is to develop a Courses portal for a campus or organization. People can register themselves to this project as Faculty for a course or students of a course. This project is a web application and it allows the registered users to join a course available in the site. Later, they can access and view the materials published for the course. When a person registers himself as Faculty for a course, this project will send an email to the Administrator for approving the person as a Faculty. The course home page contains the title of the course and a brief description about the course. The Online course portal project has an admin approval page and in that page, the administrator can approve the faculty members for the course. This project has an extra link for the faculty members. Here, they can upload the course content in a zip file format. This project has many sections and they are given below:

1. Course content section – it provides the links for the materials required for the course. 

2. Announcement section – it contains the latest announcements and notices. 

3. Discussion board for each course – here students can interact with each other.  

This project should provide facility for the faculty members to create a test for the course specifying the test title and a set of multiple-choice questions and duration of time of the  test. The course content should be uploaded in the zip file format and the course content should be HTML pages. This project is very useful for the campus or organization
